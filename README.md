## About
A javascript program that lets you control the temperature of a thermostat via an interface. All testing done in Jasmine. To start, create the database thermostat_development and run bundle. Run rackup to see how the program works.


## The Program
The temperature of the thermostat starts at 20째C. The power-saving-mode is initially on which inhibits you from turning the heating on above 25째C. If you turn power saving mode off, you will be able to turn the temperature up to 32째C. If you would like to know the temperature of a city just enter the name into the 'city' box. This will show you the temperature. If you enter a non-existing city, an alert will pop up. You can also reset the temperature to 20째C.
